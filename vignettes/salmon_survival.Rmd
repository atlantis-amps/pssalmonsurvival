Model ensemble was developed with alternate parametrizations. Plot biomass trajectories based on simulations that run the model ensemble 30 years under constant fishing rates. We only use 6 model variants, 2:5 and 7:8

```{r}

data(ensemblebiomass)
plotmodels <- c(1,6)
plot_ensemblebiomass(ensemblebiomass, plotmodels)
